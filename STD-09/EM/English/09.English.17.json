      "question_id": 151,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Compare the story told by the aunt with the story told by the bachelor.",
      "answer": "The aunt's story was a traditional, moralistic tale about a good girl who is saved from a mad bull because everyone admires her goodness. It was dull and predictable, failing to engage the children. In contrast, the bachelor's story was unconventional and satirical. It featured a 'horribly good' girl who is eaten by a wolf precisely because her medals for goodness gave her away. The bachelor's story contained realistic details (like pigs eating flowers) and a dark twist, which the children found 'beautiful' and entertaining."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 152,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "What is the satirical element in the story 'The Storyteller'?",
      "answer": "The story satirizes the conventional method of teaching moral values to children through boring, unrealistic stories where goodness is always rewarded. Saki mocks the aunt's ineffective attempt to control the children with a dull story. The bachelor's story turns the moral lesson on its head: Bertha's extreme goodness (symbolized by her medals) actually leads to her death. This challenges the idea that virtue is its own protection and suggests that children prefer entertainment and realism over heavy-handed moralizing."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 153,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Analyze the character of the aunt based on her interaction with the children.",
      "answer": "The aunt is portrayed as conventional, unimaginative, and incapable of understanding or managing children. She constantly says 'Don't' and fails to answer their questions satisfactorily, as seen with Cyril's query about the sheep. Her story is meant to be educational but is merely boring. She is easily shocked by the bachelor's 'improper' story and fails to see why the children preferred it. She represents the rigid, ineffective adult authority figure that Saki often mocks."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 154,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Discuss the significance of the title 'The Storyteller'.",
      "answer": "The title refers primarily to the bachelor, who proves to be a superior storyteller compared to the aunt. While the aunt fails to capture the children's imagination with her moralistic tale, the bachelor succeeds by understanding what children actually find interesting—action, novelty, and a lack of preachy morals. The title highlights the art of storytelling itself, suggesting that a good story needs 'the ring of truth' and entertainment value rather than just a moral lesson."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 155,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Why did the children appreciate the detail about the pigs and flowers in the bachelor's story?",
      "answer": "The children appreciated the detail about the pigs eating the flowers because it offered a logical, albeit unusual, explanation for why there were no flowers in the park. In the aunt's world, things happen for moral reasons; in the bachelor's story, things happen for practical reasons (pigs eat flowers). This detail gave the story a 'ring of truth' and coherence that the children felt was lacking in the aunt's simplistic narrative. It showed the bachelor treated them as intelligent listeners."
