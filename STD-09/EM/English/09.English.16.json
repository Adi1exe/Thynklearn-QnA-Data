    {
      "question_id": 151,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain the poet's view on the difference between offering advice and truly listening.",
      "answer": "The poet distinguishes clearly between advice and listening. Advice is portrayed as something 'cheap' and readily available, often given when not requested. It creates a sense of failure in the listener-speaker dynamic because it ignores the speaker's need to be heard. True listening, on the other hand, involves just hearing the person without judgment, interruption, or the urge to 'fix' things. The poet believes that listening allows the speaker to process their own feelings, whereas advice often shuts down that process."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 152,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "How does the poem describe the psychological impact of doing things for others that they can do themselves?",
      "answer": "The poem suggests that when someone does something for another person that they are capable of doing themselves, it has a negative psychological impact. Instead of being helpful, it contributes to the person's feelings of 'fear and inadequacy'. It reinforces the idea that they are helpless, even if they are just currently discouraged or faltering. The poet emphasizes the importance of self-reliance and the need for individuals to tackle their own problems to overcome these negative feelings."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 153,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Why does the speaker use the example of God to explain effective listening?",
      "answer": "The speaker uses God as the ultimate example of a good listener because God is described as 'mute' in the context of immediate conversation. God does not interrupt, give cheap advice, or try to 'fix things' for the person praying. Instead, God 'just listens' and allows the individual the space to work out their problems on their own. This silence and acceptance create a safe environment for the speaker to find their own clarity and solutions."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 154,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Discuss the significance of accepting 'irrational feelings' as presented in the poem.",
      "answer": "The poem argues that accepting irrational feelings is a crucial step in emotional processing. When a listener tries to convince the speaker not to feel a certain way, it invalidates those feelings. However, if the listener accepts the feelings as a 'simple fact', the speaker can stop arguing and start examining the root cause of those feelings. The poet suggests that once the underlying reasons are understood, even irrational feelings begin to make sense, leading to clarity and obvious solutions."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 155,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Summarize the 'Dos and Don'ts' of listening based on the speaker's requests.",
      "answer": "Based on the poem, the 'Dos' of listening include: just listening and hearing the speaker, accepting their feelings as facts, waiting for a turn to speak, and letting the speaker work things out. The 'Don'ts' include: giving advice when not asked, telling the speaker why they shouldn't feel a certain way, trying to solve the problem for them, and doing things for the speaker that they can do themselves. The core message is to provide presence and acceptance rather than intervention."
