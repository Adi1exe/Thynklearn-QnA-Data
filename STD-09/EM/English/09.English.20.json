      "question": "Compare the singing of Tansen and his Ostad as depicted in the poem.",
      "answer": "Tansen is described as the 'Gem of the Court' who can enchant the Emperor with his Deepak Raga. However, his singing is bound by his duty to an earthly king. The Ostad, on the other hand, dwells in the Himalayas and sings the Malkous Raga with a divine power that enchants nature itself. His music has a 'celestial sound' that transports listeners to a heavenly state. Tansen acknowledges that his music is like 'chaff' compared to his Master's 'corn' because his Master sings freely for God, while Tansen sings for a human master."

      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain the significance of Akbar dressing as a slave in the poem.",
      "answer": "Akbar dressing as a 'poor slave' signifies his humility and immense respect for true art. Despite being a mighty Emperor who commands vast territories, he recognizes that the Ostad's divine gift places him above earthly royalty. By shedding his royal robes for rags, Akbar acknowledges that spiritual and artistic greatness cannot be commanded or bought; it must be approached with reverence and humility. It shows that true music transcends social status."

      "question_id": 153,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Describe the scene when the Ostad sang the Malkous Raga.",
      "answer": "When the Ostad began to sing the Malkous Raga, it was a moment of pure magic. He sat on his prayer carpet in the Himalayas, singing to the blue sky. The music was so enchanting that even the birds and beasts gathered to listen. Akbar felt as though he was dreaming, transported to a state of 'heavenly delight' and peace. The music was described as a 'celestial sound' that made the listener forget the world, highlighting the divine power of the Ostad's voice."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 154,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "What lesson does Tansen teach Akbar at the end of the poem?",
      "answer": "At the end of the poem, Tansen teaches Akbar a profound lesson about the source of true artistic greatness. When Akbar asks why Tansen cannot sing like his Master, Tansen explains that the motivation behind the music matters. Tansen sings to please an earthly king (Akbar), which limits his art. In contrast, his Master sings for God, the King of Kings, with no desire for earthly reward. This purity of purpose imbues the Master's music with a divine quality that Tansen cannot replicate."
