      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain how the author uses the example of Aristotle to illustrate the importance of observation.",
      "answer": "The author points out that Aristotle, despite being a great philosopher, believed that women have fewer teeth than men. This was a simple error that could have been corrected by a simple observation—asking his wife to keep her mouth open while he counted. Russell uses this example to show that even intelligent people can fall into the trap of 'intellectual rubbish' if they rely on dogmatic beliefs instead of making their own observations to verify facts."

      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Discuss the author's views on how to deal with conflicting opinions that cause anger.",
      "answer": "Russell argues that if an opinion contrary to your own makes you angry, it is a sign that you are subconsciously aware of having no good reason for your belief. If your belief was based on solid evidence, like a mathematical truth, you would not get angry but rather feel pity for the other person's ignorance. Therefore, anger is an indicator of doubt. The remedy is to observe oneself and realize that passions run highest where evidence is weakest."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 153,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "How does Russell suggest we can rid ourselves of 'insular prejudice'?",
      "answer": "Russell suggests that travel is a good way to diminish insular prejudice by exposing us to different customs and beliefs. However, for those who cannot travel, he advises seeking out people with whom you disagree. This can be done by reading newspapers from opposing parties or having imaginary arguments with people who have different biases, such as Mahatma Gandhi or Lenin. This practice helps to break down the walls of our own limited perspectives."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 154,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Analyze the role of fear in generating 'intellectual rubbish' according to the text.",
      "answer": "According to Russell, fear is the most difficult source of error to remove because it works subconsciously. Fear of the unknown, fear of death, or fear of others can lead us to create comforting myths or cruel justifications. For example, fear can lead to the belief in magic or the invention of reasons why certain people deserve suffering. To avoid this, we must conquer fear either through intellectual persuasion that the danger is not real or through the moral cultivation of courage."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 155,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Summarize the author's arguments against the 'conceit' of humanity.",
      "answer": "The author argues against the general human conceit that man is the supreme work of the universe. He points out that we inhabit a small planet in a tiny corner of the cosmos and our existence is likely a brief episode. To counter this arrogance, he suggests reminding ourselves of our insignificance in the vastness of the universe. He implies that other parts of the cosmos may contain life forms as superior to us as we are to jellyfish, and that recognizing this can help cure us of our self-importance."
