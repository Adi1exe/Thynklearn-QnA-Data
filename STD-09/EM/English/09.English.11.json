The 1910 boy wears a traditional kurta-pyjama and cap. The 1800 boy is dressed in a dhoti, kurta, and a small turban. Going further back, the 1500 boy wears a sleeveless V-neck top and short dhoti. The 1000 CE boy wears a flare tunic and churidar. The 1st Century CE boy wears a dhoti and waistband with no shirt. Finally, the 3000 BCE boy wears only a cloth around his waist held by a cord[cite: 283, 288, 300, 307, 314, 322, 329]."

      "answer": "The chores of the boy from the 1950s are relatively modern and domestic, such as watering the garden, buying groceries, dusting the living room, and cleaning a bicycle. In contrast, the boy from 3000 BCE performs survival-based and labor-intensive tasks. He hunts for food, helps carve stone bricks for shelter, dusts leather clothes, and moulds mud pots for cooking. This comparison highlights how daily responsibilities have shifted from basic survival to home maintenance over 5000 years[cite: 285, 330, 331, 332]."

      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "What is the central theme of the skit 'The Past in the Present'?",
      "answer": "The central theme of the skit is that while times, technology, and lifestyles change, certain responsibilities and the need for discipline remain constant across generations. Neel believes his life is difficult because he has to make his bed, but the skit demonstrates that boys throughout history—from the 1950s back to 3000 BCE—had far more arduous physical chores to complete. Despite their hard work, they were still expected to maintain personal discipline, such as making their beds. It emphasizes that basic duties are timeless[cite: 200, 337, 339]."

      "question_id": 154,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "How does the play use the character of 'Mom' to teach Neel a lesson?",
      "answer": "The character of 'Mom' serves as the bridge between the present and the past. She initiates the lesson by introducing Neel to his ancestors when he complains about his chores. Throughout the skit, the mothers from different eras appear to reinforce the same rule: 'Make your bed.' By showing that every mother, regardless of the century, demanded this discipline despite the boys' hard labor, Neel's Mom effectively proves that his complaints are unjustified and that he has it much easier than his forefathers[cite: 278, 287, 298, 336]."

      "question_id": 155,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Analyze Neel's reaction to his ancestors and his final realization.",
      "answer": "Initially, Neel is irritated and dismissive of his chores, questioning their necessity. As he meets his ancestors, he listens to their lists of heavy labor with growing surprise and realization. For instance, he is shocked to learn about grinding stones and the lack of electricity in 1910. By the end of the play, Neel realizes that teenage boys have always had chores to do, both outdoors and indoors, often much harder than his own. He accepts this reality, although he still humorously wishes for a robot to do the work for him[cite: 266, 292, 337, 340]."
