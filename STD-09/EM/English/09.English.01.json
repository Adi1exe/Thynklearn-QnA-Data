      "answer": "The poet Charlotte Bronte encourages a positive outlook on life. She advises not to believe that life is a 'dark dream'. She suggests that sorrows ('clouds of gloom') are temporary ('transient') and often bring good results, like rain making roses bloom. We should enjoy the happy times ('sunny hours') gratefully. Even when death or sorrow strikes, we should not lose hope. Hope is resilient and strong. Finally, she urges us to bear trials 'manfully' and 'fearlessly', letting courage conquer despair."

      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain the metaphor 'If the shower will make the roses bloom, Oh, why lament its fall?'.",
      "answer": "In these lines, 'the shower' (rain) represents sorrows, difficulties, or hardships in life. 'Roses bloom' represents the good outcomes, happiness, or growth that follow these hardships. The poet is asking why we should feel sad about difficulties if they eventually lead to something beautiful and positive. It teaches us to see the positive purpose behind our struggles."

It acknowledges the reality of sorrow and death but emphasizes the power of hope and courage to overcome them. The rhythm is quick, matching the message of life flitting by rapidly."

      "question_id": 29,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "What are the rhetorical questions (interrogations) used in the poem and what points do they make?",
      "answer": "1. 'If the shower will make the roses bloom, Oh, why lament its fall?' - Point: We should not grieve over temporary sorrows that bring good results.\n2. 'What though death at times steps in, And calls our Best away?' - Point: Even death, though painful, is a part of life that we must accept without losing hope.\n3. 'What though Sorrow seems to win, O'er hope a heavy sway?' - Point: Sorrow's victory is only temporary; it cannot permanently defeat hope."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 30,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Write a short paragraph on the importance of 'Hope' based on the poem.",
      "answer": "Based on the poem, Hope is the sustaining force of life. It is described as 'elastic' and 'unconquered', meaning it always bounces back no matter how many times it falls. It has 'golden wings' that are 'buoyant' and strong enough to bear us up during difficult times. Even when sorrow seems to take over, Hope returns to save us. It is the companion of courage that allows us to face life's trials victoriously."
