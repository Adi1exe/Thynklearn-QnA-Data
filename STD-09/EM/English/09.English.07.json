[cite_start]Hunters follow this trail to the nest, which is typically half a metre deep, to find the eggs[cite: 35]. [cite_start]A major challenge is that these species are endangered because human activity in their habitat is causing them to die out[cite: 30]."

[cite_start]Bullet point presentations are also suggested to discuss the prudent utilization of natural resources and the scope for tourism to ensure a sustainable future for the turtles[cite: 35]."
