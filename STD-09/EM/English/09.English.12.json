      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Describe the scene depicted in the poem 'Silver' in your own words.",
      "answer": "The poem describes a serene night scene illuminated by the moon. As the moon moves slowly and silently across the sky, its light transforms everything into silver. Trees and their fruit appear silver, and windows shine under silver thatched roofs. A dog sleeps soundly like a log with silver paws, while doves rest in their shelter. Even the small harvest mouse and the motionless fish in the stream catch the silvery glint of the moonlight, creating a unified, magical, and metallic atmosphere."
    },

      "question_id": 152,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain the use of the word 'silver' in the poem. Why is it repeated so often?",
      "answer": "The word 'silver' is repeated throughout the poem to emphasize the dominant visual effect of the moonlight. It serves as a unifying motif that connects unrelated objects—trees, fruit, thatch, paws, doves, mouse claws, eyes, reeds, and the stream. This repetition creates a sense of harmony and stillness, suggesting that the moonlight has cast a magical spell over the entire landscape, washing everything in the same precious, metallic hue."

    {
      "question_id": 153,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Identify and explain two figures of speech used in the poem.",
      "answer": "Two prominent figures of speech in the poem are Personification and Simile. \n1. **Personification:** The moon is personified as a woman who 'walks the night in her silver shoon' and 'peers' at the world. This gives the moon a gentle, living presence.\n2. **Simile:** The dog is described as sleeping 'like a log'. This comparison vividly conveys how deep and motionless the dog's sleep is."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 154,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "How does the poet create a sense of stillness and silence in the poem?",
      "answer": "The poet uses specific vocabulary and imagery to create a quiet atmosphere. Words like 'slowly', 'silently', 'sleeps', 'moveless', and phrases like 'couched in his kennel' and 'shadowy cote' contribute to the feeling of rest. The subjects of the poem—the sleeping dog, the resting doves, and the motionless fish—are all in a state of repose. Even the moon moves 'silently', ensuring that the visual beauty of the scene is not disturbed by sound."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 155,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Contrast the movement of the harvest mouse with the other animals in the poem.",
      "answer": "Most animals in the poem are described in a state of deep rest or stillness: the dog sleeps 'like a log', the doves are in their 'shadowy cote', and the fish are 'moveless'. In contrast, the harvest mouse provides a small element of activity as it goes 'scampering by'. However, even this movement is subtle and quiet, fitting into the overall peaceful night scene without disrupting the silence."
