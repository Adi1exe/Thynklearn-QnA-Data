School of Art in Mumbai before moving to France. His style evolved into abstract art characterized by simple geometric shapes and striking colors like blue and orange. Unlike realistic art, his work did not depict lifelike figures but originated from his inner mind. Over time, the 'bindu' or point became the spiritual core of his paintings, reflecting Indian philosophy and radiating peace[cite: 506, 507, 510, 517, 518, 519, 523]."

      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain the significance of the medium and materials used in Gond Art.",
      "answer": "Gond Art reflects a deep connection with nature through its choice of medium. Originally, the 'canvas' was the earthen walls of houses. The colors were prepared naturally using soils of different shades, plant juices, leaves, tree bark, flowers, fruits, coal, and cow-dung. This process of preparing one's own canvas and colors from the environment makes the creation of folk art a very enriching experience, preserving the art form's simplicity and richness year after year[cite: 535, 540, 541, 543, 544]."

      "question_id": 153,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Compare the artistic philosophy of Raza with the traditional approach of Gond Art.",
      "answer": "Raza's art is abstract and spiritual, originating from an attempt to peep into his own 'inner mind'. It focuses on geometric composition, balance, and the metaphysical 'bindu', uninfluenced by external factors. In contrast, Gond Art is a folk tradition deeply rooted in external nature and community life. It involves recording what is seen, preserving myths and legends, and decorating homes. While Raza's art is an individual's complex inner expression, Gond Art is a communal, smoothly flowing process transferred across generations[cite: 510, 524, 532, 537, 539]."

      "question_id": 154,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "How does the passage justify the idea that folk art roots lie in women's daily chores?",
      "answer": "The passage suggests that the origins of folk art are closely linked to the domestic activities of women. It highlights that women traditionally handled chores like cleaning and decorating the house, which provided a surface for art. Furthermore, in the course of cooking and leisure activities, women dealt with natural colors and materials. This familiarity with using natural elements for decoration and daily tasks likely evolved into the artistic expression seen in styles like Gond art[cite: 552]."

    {
      "question_id": 155,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Discuss the visual language of Gond Art including its designs and textures.",
      "answer": "The visual language of Gond Art is defined by its lively and attractive designs that fill the outlines of the subject. These designs rely on simple textures created through the use of dots, straight lines, dotted lines, curvy shapes, and circles. While outlines may vary between artists, the filling designs and the careful choice of various colors create an amazing and beautiful total effect. This simplicity in technique allows the art to be easily transferred and preserved across generations[cite: 537, 548, 549, 550]."
