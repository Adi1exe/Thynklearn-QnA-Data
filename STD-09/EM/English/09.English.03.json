      "question": "What is a Homograph? Explain with two examples given in the 'Warming up' section.",
      "answer": "A homograph is a word that has the same spelling as another word but differs in meaning when used in different contexts. Examples from the text:\n1. 'Fair': (a) A temple fair (gathering/carnival). (b) Her performance was fair (average/good).\n2. 'Rose': (a) A rose is the king of flowers (a flower). (b) The sun rose with a golden glow (past tense of rise)."

      "question_id": 27,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Analyze the humor in the poem 'Have you ever seen...?'. How does the poet create it?",
      "answer": "The humor in the poem is created through the clever use of puns and homographs. The poet takes the names of parts of inanimate objects (like the 'head' of a hammer, 'eye' of a needle, 'foot' of a mountain) and treats them as if they are parts of a living body or a different object with the same name. By asking absurd questions based on these literal interpretations—like asking if a hammer has hair or if a mountain has toes—the poet creates funny and imaginative mental images."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 28,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain the following lines: 'Can the garden plot be deep and dark? And what is the sound of the birch's bark?'.",
      "answer": "In the first line, the poet plays on the word 'plot'. A 'garden plot' is simply a patch of land. However, a 'plot' can also mean a wicked scheme or conspiracy, which is often described as 'deep and dark'. The poet humorously asks if a piece of land can be a wicked scheme.\nIn the second line, the play is on the word 'bark'. 'Bark' is the outer skin of a tree (birch tree). 'Bark' is also the sound a dog makes. The poet humorously asks what sound the tree's skin makes, treating it like the animal sound."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 29,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Identify and explain three puns used in the 'Warming up' exercise (Q5).",
      "answer": "1. 'She had a photographic memory but never developed it': The pun is on 'developed'. It refers to utilizing a skill, but in photography, it refers to processing film to see pictures.\n2. 'I'd tell you a chemistry joke but I know I wouldn't get a reaction': The pun is on 'reaction'. In chemistry, it's a chemical process; socially, it's a response to a joke.\n3. 'What do you call Watson when Sherlock isn't around? Homeless': The pun is on 'Homeless'. It sounds like 'Holmes-less' (without Sherlock Holmes), while also meaning having no home."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 30,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "What is 'Interrogation' as a figure of speech? Give examples from the poem.",
      "answer": "Interrogation, or Rhetorical Question, is a figure of speech where a question is asked not to get an answer, but to emphasize a point or fact. The entire poem 'Have you ever seen...?' is built on this device. Examples include:\n1. 'Have you ever seen a sheet on a river bed?'\n2. 'Has the foot of a mountain any toes?'\n3. 'Does the needle ever wink its eye?'\nThese questions highlight the double meanings of the words rather than seeking literal answers."
