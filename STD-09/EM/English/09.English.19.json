      "question_id": 151,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Analyze the character of the narrator in 'My Financial Career'.",
      "answer": "The narrator is a timid, diffident, and highly nervous individual when it comes to financial matters. He describes himself as a 'hesitating jay' and an 'irresponsible idiot' the moment he enters a bank. His nervousness leads him to behave irrationally, such as asking to see the manager alone for a small deposit and walking into a safe. He is easily intimidated by the bank staff and surroundings. However, he also possesses a sense of humor about his own awkwardness, as he is the one retelling this embarrassing incident."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 152,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Describe the series of misunderstandings between the narrator and the bank manager.",
      "answer": "The misunderstanding begins when the narrator asks to see the manager 'alone' with a solemn and mysterious air. This leads the manager to believe the narrator is a detective from Pinkerton's with an awful secret. When the narrator denies this, his mysterious manner makes the manager suspect he is from a rival agency. Finally, when the narrator reveals he just wants to open an account, the manager assumes he must be a wealthy heir (son of Rothschild or Gould) making a large deposit, only to be disappointed by the small sum of fifty-six dollars."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 153,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "How does Stephen Leacock use humor in the story?",
      "answer": "Leacock uses exaggeration and situational irony to create humor. The narrator's extreme physical reactions to the bank (shambling, voice becoming sepulchral) are funny. The contrast between the manager's expectation of a detective or millionaire and the reality of a nervous clerk with $56 is a key source of comedy. The climax of the humor occurs when the narrator mistakenly withdraws all his money immediately after depositing it, pretending to be insulted to cover his error, and then asks for 'sixes' while leaving."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 154,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain the significance of the ending of the story.",
      "answer": "The ending reinforces the narrator's total defeat by the banking system. After the roar of laughter that follows his exit, he decides never to bank again. His decision to keep cash in his pocket and savings in a sock highlights his retreat to a primitive and 'safe' method of money management. It concludes the theme of the story: that for some common people, the formal and imposing nature of financial institutions is too overwhelming to navigate."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 155,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Why did the narrator withdraw all his money immediately after depositing it?",
      "answer": "The narrator intended to withdraw only six dollars for present use. However, in his confused and nervous state, he wrote a check for fifty-six dollars—the entire amount he had just deposited. When the clerk pointed this out in surprise, the narrator realized his mistake but felt 'too far gone' to explain it. To save face and hide his foolishness, he pretended that he wanted to withdraw everything because he had been insulted, acting recklessly with misery."
