      "question": "Discuss the grammatical restrictions when using 'have' as a main verb regarding continuous forms and negative structures.",
      "answer": "When 'have' acts as a main verb indicating state or possession, it cannot be used in the present continuous form. [cite_start]For instance, 'I am having a bicycle' is incorrect; it should be 'I have a bicycle'[cite: 405]. Similarly, in negative sentences, 'have' as a main verb does not directly take 'not' (e.g., 'He hasn't a car' is wrong). [cite_start]Instead, it requires the auxiliary verb 'do' or 'does' to form the negative, such as 'He doesn't have a car'[cite: 405]."
