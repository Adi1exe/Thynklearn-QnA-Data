      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain how the poet personifies Autumn as a maiden fair.",
      "answer": "The poet personifies Autumn by giving her human physical attributes and accessories. She is described as slender and graceful, wearing rice-stems in her hair and lilies on her face. Her clothing is made of grass flowers, and she wears a diadem of stars and a robe of moonlight at night. These human-like descriptions bring the season to life as a beautiful young woman."

      "question": "Describe the imagery of night as presented in the poem 'Autumn'.",
      "answer": "The poem presents a vivid and beautiful image of the night during Autumn. The night is adorned with a 'diadem' or crown of countless stars. The moonlight is described as a white 'silken robe' that flows freely, no longer trapped by clouds. The moon itself is personified as the maiden's radiant face, displaying bewitching smiles, creating a serene and magical atmosphere."

      "question_id": 153,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Interpret the lines: 'She seems a slender maid, who soon / Will be a woman grown.'",
      "answer": "These lines suggest the progression of the season. Initially, Autumn is delicate and slender, like a young maiden, representing the early phase of the season. However, as time passes, the season will mature and reach its peak fullness, just as a young maiden grows into a woman. This implies the transition from early harvest to the full abundance of the season."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 154,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "How does the poet use nature to describe the maiden's accessories and clothing?",
      "answer": "The poet cleverly uses natural elements to represent the maiden's attire. Her hair is decorated with 'nodding rice-stems', and her face resembles 'lilies'. She is dressed in 'flowers of grasses', and the cooing of birds acts as the sound of her bracelets. At night, the stars form her crown, and the moonlight becomes her silken robe, seamlessly blending nature with human fashion."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 155,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Discuss the use of simile and metaphor in the poem with examples.",
      "answer": "The poem effectively uses both simile and metaphor. A prominent simile is found in the line 'Birds greet her with their cooing glad / Like a bracelet's tinkling song,' comparing bird sounds to jewelry. Metaphors are used throughout, such as describing Autumn directly as 'a maiden fair,' the stars as a 'diadem,' and the moonlight as a 'silken robe.' These devices enrich the visual imagery of the poem."
