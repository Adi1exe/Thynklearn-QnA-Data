      "answer": "Taffy drew a picture intending to ask her mother for a new spear. She drew her father with a broken spear to explain why he needed a new one. However, the Stranger-man, who did not understand their language, interpreted the broken spear as an injury or an attack. He believed the picture showed a great Chief (Tegumai) surrounded by enemies and in danger. While Taffy thought she was sending a simple request for a tool, the Stranger-man thought he was carrying a desperate plea for military reinforcements to save the Chief's life[cite: 915, 945]."

      "question": "Describe Teshumai Tewindrow's reaction to the drawing and how it differed from the Stranger-man's intention.",
      "answer": "The Stranger-man delivered the drawing to Teshumai with a polite smile, thinking he was doing a noble deed by fetching help. However, Teshumai completely misinterpreted the primitive drawing. Instead of seeing a request for a spear, she saw a depiction of her husband being attacked. She believed the Stranger-man himself had 'stuck Tegumai all full of spears' and terrified Taffy. Consequently, instead of being grateful, she screamed, attacked the stranger, and had the other ladies sit on him, creating a chaotic and humorous situation[cite: 959, 963, 964]."

      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "What does the story suggest about the difficulties of communication without a common language?",
      "answer": "The story humorously highlights the chaos that can arise from a lack of a common language. Taffy and the Stranger-man try to communicate through gestures and drawings, but their different cultural backgrounds and assumptions lead to wild misinterpretations. Taffy's 'stamping foot' is seen as a sign of nobility, and her 'broken spear' drawing is seen as a war scene. The story illustrates that visual symbols are not always universal and that context is crucial for understanding. Without words, a simple request for a fishing tool turned into a perceived tribal war[cite: 886, 900, 945]."

      "question_id": 154,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Characterize Taffy based on her interactions with the Stranger-man.",
      "answer": "Taffy is portrayed as a confident, somewhat impatient, and imaginative child. Her name, meaning 'Small-person-without-any-manners', reflects her behavior as she stamps her foot and demands the stranger to do her bidding. She assumes the stranger understands her despite his silence. However, she is also creative and resourceful, coming up with the idea to draw a message when she couldn't write. She is affectionate towards her father ('Daddy dear') and polite in her own way, trying to explain the picture to the stranger, even though he couldn't understand her[cite: 865, 890, 892, 907]."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 155,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Why did the Stranger-man consider Taffy and her father to be 'wonderful' and 'noble'?",
      "answer": "The Stranger-man projected his own tribal beliefs and fears onto Taffy and Tegumai. He thought Tegumai was a 'Noble Chief' because he ignored him (which was actually just Tegumai being busy). He thought Taffy was a 'wonderful child' because she wasn't afraid to touch his 'magic' shark's tooth, which he believed would make anyone else burst. Her demanding behavior (stamping her foot) was interpreted by him as the authority of a Chief's daughter rather than the impatience of a child[cite: 896, 911]."
