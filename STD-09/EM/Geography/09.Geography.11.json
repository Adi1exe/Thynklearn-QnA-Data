      "question": "Discuss the importance of transportation for a region's development.",
      "answer": "Transportation is a basic infrastructure. Its development indicates the region's progress. It extends trade networks, promotes rapid industrialisation, and creates employment opportunities. It provides regional connectivity, overcomes scarcity by moving goods from surplus to deficit areas, decreases regional imbalance, and boosts tourism. Ultimately, it increases the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and per capita income."

      "answer": "The western part of Satara district is occupied by the Sahyadris with high elevation and undulating topography (e.g., Shivsagar reservoir), resulting in a sparse transport network. The central and eastern parts have lower elevation, facilitating a denser network with National Highways and railways. This shows that plains support dense transport networks, while hilly terrains restrict them."

The internet and social media allow instant exchange of information. Apps like BHIM facilitate online payments and transactions. These means have made communication faster, cheaper, and more efficient, connecting the entire world."

    {
      "question_id": 26,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "What is cyber crime and what measures should be taken to prevent it?",

To prevent it, one should not share sensitive personal information (like bank details, passwords) on social networks or unverified sites. Users should be aware of threats and ensure the safety of the platforms they use."
