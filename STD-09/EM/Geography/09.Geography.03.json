      "question": "Explain the process of Mechanical Weathering with its various types.",
      "answer": "Mechanical weathering is the physical breakdown of rocks. Its types include: 1. Temperature: Daily heating and cooling cause expansion and contraction, leading to cracks and exfoliation. 2. Frost: Freezing water in cracks expands, breaking the rock. 3. Crystal Growth: Salt crystals growing in rock pores exert pressure. 4. Release of Pressure: Removal of overlying pressure causes lower rocks to expand and break. 5. Water: Some rocks like sandstone absorb water and disintegrate into grains (granular weathering)."

      "question_id": 42,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Describe the different types of Chemical Weathering.",
      "answer": "Chemical weathering involves chemical changes in rocks. Main types are: 1. Carbonation: CO2 in air mixes with rain to form carbonic acid, which dissolves limestone. 2. Solution: Soluble minerals dissolve in water (e.g., salts in alkalis), making rocks porous. 3. Oxidation: Iron in rocks reacts with oxygen and water to form rust, weakening the rock structure. These processes depend on the presence of water."

      "question_id": 43,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "What is Mass Wasting and what are its types?",
      "answer": "Mass wasting is the movement of weathered material down a slope due to gravity alone. It has two main types: 1. Rapid Mass Wasting: Occurs on steep slopes with high precipitation, e.g., rockfalls, landslides, and land subsidence. It is sudden and destructive. 2. Slower Mass Wasting: Occurs on gentle slopes in dry climates, e.g., soil creep and solifluction (in periglacial areas). It happens gradually."
    },

      "question_id": 44,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Differentiate between Weathering and Mass Wasting.",
      "answer": "Weathering is the in-situ breaking or decomposition of rocks due to atmospheric and biological factors. It prepares the material for movement but does not necessarily involve moving it. Mass Wasting is the downward movement of this weathered material under the influence of gravity. While weathering breaks the rock, mass wasting transports the debris down the slope."
