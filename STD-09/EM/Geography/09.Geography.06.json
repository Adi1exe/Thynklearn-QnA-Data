      "question_id": 30,
      "question_type": "SHORT",
      "question": "Why is it easy to float in the Dead Sea?",

      "question_id": 31,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain the factors affecting the salinity of seawater.",
      "answer": "The main factors are evaporation and fresh water supply. 1. Evaporation: High evaporation leads to higher salinity (e.g., tropical zones). 2. Fresh Water Supply: Rainfall and river inflow reduce salinity (e.g., equatorial regions and Bay of Bengal). 3. Landlocked vs Open Seas: Landlocked seas in warm zones have higher salinity due to limited mixing and high evaporation (e.g., Mediterranean, Red Sea). 4. Latitude: Temperate zones have lower evaporation, hence lower salinity."

    {
      "question_id": 32,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Describe the vertical distribution of temperature in oceans.",
      "answer": "The temperature of seawater changes with depth. 1. Surface layer: Temperature is higher and variable due to solar energy. 2. Up to 500m: Temperature decreases rapidly. 3. 500m to 1000m: The rate of decrease lessens. 4. Below 2000m: Temperature becomes uniform, around 4°C, from equator to poles. Deep ocean water does not freeze easily."

      "question_id": 33,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain the relationship between Temperature, Salinity, and Density.",
      "answer": "These three properties are interconnected. 1. Density depends on temperature and salinity. 2. Temperature is the major factor; colder water is denser. 3. Salinity also increases density, but its effect is less than temperature. 4. Cold water with low salinity can be denser than warm water with high salinity. 5. Ocean currents are generated due to differences in these properties, acting as global temperature controllers."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 34,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Why is there a difference in salinity between the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal?",
      "answer": "The Arabian Sea experiences higher evaporation and receives less fresh water from rivers. The Bay of Bengal receives abundant fresh water from major rivers like the Ganga, Brahmaputra, and Mahanadi, and also receives more rainfall. Consequently, the salinity of the Arabian Sea (approx. 36‰) is higher than that of the Bay of Bengal (approx. 32‰)."

      "question_id": 35,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Discuss the distribution of salinity across different latitudinal zones.",
      "answer": "1. Equatorial Zone (0°-15°): Salinity is moderate (34‰) due to high rainfall and cloud cover reducing evaporation. 2. Tropical Zone (15°-35°): Salinity is high (37‰) due to high evaporation and low rainfall. 3. Temperate Zone (35°-65°): Salinity is low (33‰) due to low evaporation and rainfall. 4. Polar Zone (65°-90°): Salinity is lowest (31‰) due to very low evaporation and melting of ice."
