      "question_id": 31,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain the erosional, transportation, and depositional work of rivers.",
      "answer": "Rivers erode their bed and banks in high altitude areas due to fast flow, forming gorges and V-shaped valleys[cite: 1]. They transport sediments downstream. At foothills, reduced speed leads to the deposition of coarse sediments forming alluvial fans[cite: 1]. In plains, rivers meander and deposit fine sediments during floods, creating flood levees and flood plains[cite: 1]. Finally, near the sea, the river splits into distributaries depositing sediments to form a delta[cite: 1]."

      "question_id": 32,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Describe the work of a glacier and the landforms it produces.",
      "answer": "Glaciers move slowly but have great mass, eroding their bed and banks to form cirques, arêtes, horns, and U-shaped valleys[cite: 3]. They transport sediments known as moraines (ground, lateral, medial, terminal)[cite: 3]. When the glacier melts, it deposits these sediments, forming landforms like drumlins and eskers[cite: 3]."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 33,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "How does the wind modify the landscape in desert regions?",
      "answer": "Wind erodes rocks by friction with sand particles, creating mushroom rocks and yardangs[cite: 5]. It transports sand particles over distances. When the wind speed reduces, it deposits the sand, forming sand dunes like barchans and seifs, ripple marks, and extensive loess plains[cite: 5]."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 34,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain the work of sea waves along the coast.",
      "answer": "Sea waves erode the coast by hitting rocks, forming sea cliffs, sea caves, and sea arches. Continuous erosion can leave isolated pillars called sea stacks[cite: 7]. The eroded material is moved by tides and deposited in areas with less wave effect, forming beaches, sand bars, and lagoons[cite: 7]."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 35,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Describe the work of groundwater in limestone regions.",
      "answer": "Groundwater dissolves soluble minerals like calcium in limestone rocks (erosion), creating sinkholes and caves[cite: 9]. As the water drips in caves and evaporates, the dissolved minerals are deposited, forming stalactites (hanging from the roof) and stalagmites (growing from the floor)[cite: 9]."
